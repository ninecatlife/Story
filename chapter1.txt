this is how to use the terminal on vscode and add bash

first you go to terminal > New terminal
before that you go to https://gitforwindows.org/ and download Git SCM, install it. 
At the top left of your vscode, click on View > Command Pallete > Terminal: Select Default Profile > Git bash 
So you select the Git Bash that you installed

for the new command terminal you created. Here are some command for windows

#1 Move from one folder to a subfolder
cd <folder_name>
If you are on onedrive or any folder and want to locate a sub folder, use cd <folder name>
this moves you from  onedrive to Desktop ~/OneDrive/Desktop

#2 Create new directory
mkdir <new_folder_name>

#3 List content of a directory
ls 

#4 Create new file
code <file_name>

#5 Create Git
git init

#6 See all the hidden file
ls -a

#7 see whats on the staging area
git status
In order to track our files, we need to add the working directory to the staging area
the staging area is an intermediate area where you can chose the files you want to commit
to see whats on your staging area, you use git status command.
Here it shows the untracked files and committed files

#8 Add to staging area
git add <file_name>
alternatively
git add .
the . signifies that you are adding everything in the directorygi

#9 clear the terminal
clear

#10 commit to git
git commit -m "<message/comment>"

#11 Cancel command
press keyboard shortcut Control C

#12 See commit you have made
git log

#13 Add your usename and email
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "john.doe@gmail.com"

#14 to unstage
use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage

15 to descard
use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory

we paint the picture

working directory > Staging Area > commit

Working Directory 
cd <folder_name> - move to a folder
mkdir <folder_name> - create a folder
ls - list content in a directory
ls -a - see all hidden file
code <file_name> - create new file
clear - clear terminal
CTRL C - Cancel

Staging Area
git init - create a git (the first step before anything)
git status - see whats on the staging area
git add <file_name> - add a file to a staging area/ or changes that havent been committed
git add . - add all files to the staging area
git rm --cached -r . - removes all files from the staging area


git repository (commit)
git commit -m "<message/comment>" - commit to all files in staging area to commit area
git log - see commit you've made
git diff <file_name> - shows the difference between the file on the git repo and the working directory
git checkout <file_name> - revert back the file from git to working directory

committing to github (remote server)
#1 Go to github.. create new repository
you can name the repository the same as your workind directory. example for me is story
a link will be generated for your command

#2 type the following command
git remote add origin https://github.com/ninecatlife/Story.git
where the url represents the link to your repo

#3 rename your branch from master to main 
git branch -M main
(you can see the master showing in a bracket before a command, once you run the command it changes to main)

#4 Commit
git push -u origin main

#5 to clone
git clone https://github.com/example/repository.git

#6 git branch
git branch <branch-name> example git branch alien-plot

# Switch branch
git checkout alien-plot - this switches from main to alienplot
